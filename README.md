# Tetris

This is one of my first large-scale projects as an aspiring computer scientist. I created my own version 
of the popular game Tetris as a junior in high school.

## Getting Started

This is a Java game that can easily be run after downloading the bin folder and launching TetrisMain.class.

## Instructions

#### Tetris Objectives

Rotate, move, and place various cascading blocks on the game board. Once a row is completed, all the blocks are cleared
and the player's score increases. The game is lost when no more blocks can be placed on the board.

#### Tetris Controls

```
Left Arrow - Move left
Right Arrow - Move right
Down Arrow - Move down
Up Arrow - Rotate
Space - Place block all the way down
C - hold the current block until a later turn. Only one hold between block placements.
```
